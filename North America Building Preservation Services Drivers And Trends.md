<p> <h2>North America Building Preservation Services Market Driver and Trends</h2><p>The North America building preservation services market is driven by the increasing demand for the restoration and maintenance of historical and cultural structures. As cities expand and urban development progresses, the need to preserve heritage buildings has become more prominent.
